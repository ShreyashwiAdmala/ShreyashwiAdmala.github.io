## Projects

### Project 1: Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/ShreyashwiAdmala/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Movie-Reviews-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques)

In this project, I analyzed and classified sentiment of 50,000 movie reviews from Stanford's IMDB dataset as positive or negative. Implemented deep learning models, including CNN and BiLSTM, and applied advanced NLP techniques such as tokenization and lemmatization on 50,000 reviews, using pre-trained GloVe embeddings. Achieved 88% accuracy with the CNN model and 96% accuracy with the BiLSTM model, significantly enhancing sentiment classification performance.

### Project 2: Sales Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/ShreyashwiAdmala/Predicting-Sales-from-Advertisements-using-Multiple-Linear-Regression)

This project involved creating a multiple linear regression model to predict sales revenue based on advertising budgets for TV, radio, and social media, achieving an R2 value of 0.9855. Additionally, Evaluated advertising budgets and sales data for 4,538 records, identifying key trends and patterns. Delivered actionable insights and recommendations to business owners, suggesting optimized advertising budget allocations. Based on the analysis, TV and radio ads showed strong correlation with sales (correlation coefficients of 1.0 and 0.86, respectively).
